# Project 0

This is the project 0 which builds up a simple website about Thanksgiving.

There are four pages:
- Welcome page (index.html)
- Thanksgiving history in USA (about.html)
- Similar festival in other countries (country.html)
- Thanksgiving themes (portfolio.html)

Special thanks to:
 - David Miller (startbootstrap.com) who demonstrates many valuable bootstrap templates and themes to learn from.
 - css-tricks (https://css-tricks.com/) that clarify many misunderstandings and share lots of good practices.
